title: Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) for Health App
category: project
---
SAIL worked with BU Medical Campus IT to design and build a cross-platform mobile application for Devin Mann, Associate Professor of Medicine at BU and an Associate Chief Medical Information Officer at Boston Medical Center. The app enables users to track their food consumption by tapping tiles that correspond to the eight components of a healthy diet. The app connects via Bluetooth to a blood pressure monitor, scale, and pedometer; it also allows users to connect with health coaches through a messaging function. This work demonstrates how a resource like SAIL can enable a successful and sustained mobile health research ecosystem at BU.
