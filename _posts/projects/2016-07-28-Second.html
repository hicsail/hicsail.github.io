title: Natural Language Processing for Political Science
category: project
---
SAIL staff and student developers are helping Cathie Jo Martin, Professor of Political Science at Boston University, to collect natural language data sets consisting of Danish and British fiction literature from third party sources and services, and to identify and apply appropriate machine learning techniques to these corpora. This work supports Prof. Martin’s goal of understanding deep cultural differences in views toward education as they can be observed in coming-of-age novels in Britain and Denmark. This work represents a part of a broader effort to advance the digital humanities by making computational techniques more accessible to researchers in the social sciences.
