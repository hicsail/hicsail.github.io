      'Working at SAIL exposed me to a wide range of modern technologies. While working on asl-lex 3.1 and a bit on 3.0, I was required to learn AngularJS, brush up knowledge on TypeScript, HTML/CSS, work on python scripts and work on cloud technologies such as Firebase. Being exposed and seeing them implemented as a real-world project was great for me. Interns also closely work with the PIs of the projects. Lastly, the team at SAIL is open, approachable, and helpful.',

The culture isn’t hierarchical like a normal tech company. This makes you feel like a valuable, contributing member. I also felt that I was making a difference in the world. At the end of the day, SAIL's building software projects that have a purpose in the real world outside of financial incentives",
