      'Working at SAIL exposed me to a wide range of modern technologies. While working on asl-lex 3.1 and a bit on 3.0, I was required to learn AngularJS, brush up knowledge on TypeScript, HTML/CSS, work on python scripts and work on cloud technologies such as Firebase. Being exposed and seeing them implemented as a real-world project was great for me. Interns also closely work with the PIs of the projects. Lastly, the team at SAIL is open, approachable, and helpful.',
