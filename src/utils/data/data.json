At the center of this effort is testing. Once it became clear the novel coronavirus would persist into the fall of 2020, the University rapidly stood up a clinical testing lab. In addition to a trained staff, the BU Clinical Testing Laboratory is using specialized robots to accelerate testing capacity and, importantly, return results by the end of the next day. SAIL staff was instrumental in developing the automated software and data pipeline central to the testing process.",

This platform is unique in that it allows real-world organizations to use what is still largely studied as a theoretical technique, enabling analyses that would have been otherwise impossible to do while preserving the confidentiality of the participants.",
