    popTitle: 'Clinical Testing Lab',
    description:
      'To repopulate our three campuses, resume residential learning and student activities, and reopen research labs and clinics, Boston University took a comprehensive, multipronged approach to protecting the health and safety of our community and the public at large. At the center of this effort is testing. Once it became clear the novel coronavirus would persist into the fall of 2020, the University rapidly stood up a clinical testing lab. In addition to a trained staff, the BU Clinical Testing Laboratory is using specialized robots to accelerate testing capacity and, importantly, return results by the end of the next day. SAIL staff was instrumental in developing the automated software and data pipeline central to the testing process.',

    description:
      'In support of the Boston Women’s Workforce Council and its mission to advance salary equity among Boston employers as part of the 100% Talent Compact, SAIL staff and student developers built a secure multi-party computation web application that allows statistical data pertaining to compensation levels across genders and demographics to be collected from over 250 participating employer organizations, such as State Street Corporation and Putnam Investments, without requiring any organization to reveal its confidential data. This platform is unique in that it allows real-world organizations to use what is still largely studied as a theoretical technique, enabling analyses that would have been otherwise impossible to do while preserving the confidentiality of the participants.',

      'SAIL staff and student developers are helping at Boston University, to collect natural language data sets consisting of Danish and British fiction literature from third party sources and services, and to identify and apply appropriate machine learning techniques to these corpora. This work supports Prof. Martin’s goal of understanding deep cultural differences in views toward education as they can be observed in coming-of-age novels in Britain and Denmark. This work represents a part of a broader effort to advance the digital humanities by making computational techniques more accessible to researchers in the social sciences.',

    description:
      'Research has established that the environmental soundscape has a large impact on our stress levels, our sleep, and our cardiovascular and mental health. The NoiseScore application utilizes smart phone technology to capture both the objective and subjective nature of the sounds you encounter as you go about your daily routine. This information can be utilized to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of sound levels and noise perception in your community both overall and by specific sources such as loud parties, road traffic, or aircraft noise.',

    description:
      'Hey,Charlie is a non-invasive mobile behavioral modification platform designed to help individuals in recovery rebuild their social environments as well as enrich relationships with healthcare providers in order to build more targeted recovery strategies. This is realized through a series of automatic behavioral nudges on a mobile device that urge the patient to avoid communication with people and places who are unhealthy and negative to their recovery and to pursue and enrich relationships with people and places that are positive to their recovery. This information is then aggregated and conveyed to the primary recovery healthcare provider (therapist, social worker, clinician, etc.) in a secure and protected manner. Using data-driven predictive algorithms, patient notifications are tailored to individual behavior patterns.',

      'SAIL worked with BU Medical Campus IT to design and build a cross-platform mobile application for Devin Mann, Associate Professor of Medicine at BU and an Associate Chief Medical Information Officer at Boston Medical Center. The app enables users to track their food consumption by tapping tiles that correspond to the eight components of a healthy diet. The app connects via Bluetooth to a blood pressure monitor, scale, and pedometer; it also allows users to connect with health coaches through a messaging function. This work demonstrates how a resource like SAIL can enable a successful and sustained mobile health research ecosystem at BU. ',
